# COVID-19Analysis
An in-depth analysis of COVID-19 data through advanced analytical methods using Python such as exploring relationships between variables with the help of exploratory visual analysis, geospatial analysis, implementing supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms and time series analysis to derive meaningful insights.


# Analysis of COVID-19 Data
**Objective**:
The main goal of this project is to identify the conditions contributing to COVID-19 deaths across various demographics and locations in the United States. Understanding these factors will help public healthcare officials and policymakers to target interventions effectively. Thereby reducing the risk of COVID-19 deaths and improve public health services. 

## Key Questions
- What are the top 5 conditions contributing to COVID-19 deaths?
- Which age groups are mostly affected by COVID-19?
- In which year was the highest death count due to COVID-19?
- Which States in the U.S. are highly affected due to COVID-19?

## Dataset Description:

**Title**: Conditions Contributing to COVID19 Deaths by State and Age Provisional 2020-2023
**Source**:   CDC (Centre for Disease Control and Prevention)
**Content**: The dataset contains health conditions and contributing causes mentioned in conjunction with deaths involving coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by age group and jurisdiction of occurrence.
**Variables**: Date, Year, Month, State, Condition, Age group, COVID-19 Deaths, Number of Mentions on the death certificate

## Tools
Analysis has been done using Python with the following supporting libraries:
- Pandas: for data analysis
- Numpy: for mathematical equations
- Seaborn: for data visualizations
- Matplotlib: for data visualizations
- SciPy: for mathematical equations
- Scikit-Learn: Machine Learning Algorithims

## Project Deliverables
The project culminates in a comprehensive analysis, backed by Python, visualizations, and a narrative that translates complex data into actionable business insights.
